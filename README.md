# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract
This application is a movie review webpage that shows rated movies. As a user you can click on any individual movie and see either a movie poster or movie trailer. There is also more information to see such as budgets, revenue made, an overview of the movie, genres, and the overall rating given to the movie.

## Context 
This project was a paired project and took us roughly 40 hours to complete from the design/markup and brainstorming solutions/issues. 

## Cloning the repo or seeing the deployed application
### Option 1 You can clone down the repo by following these steps:
1. go to the following link `git@github.com:baileyjarvis2814/rancid_tomatillos.git`.
2. Once you're there hit `Fork` on the top right.
3. Once you fork it click on `code`.
4. From there either hit the SSH or HTTPS and copy the code to your clipboard.
5. In your local machine type `git clone (link here)`.
6. Once you clone the repo cd into the repository and then type `npm i`.
7. once that's completed type `npm start` and the page will open up on your default browser.

### Option 2 using the deployed link
1. Follow this link and you will be taken to the deployed application. (it is responsive and should work on multiple screen sizes)

## Wins 
1. Completing the intial iterations for the project within the first couple of days.
2. Converting a single page application into a multiple page application using React-router.

## Challenges 
1. Responsive layout and figuring out that our changes were only good for the time being and that we had repetitave selectors that caused the issue.
2. Trying to fetch single movie data where we were fetching all the movie data and then trying to pass it along. We ended up fetching the data inside the appropriate file that we needed it in. 
3. Cypress testing is a bit difficult at first but then we got the hang of it.
